# Space-A-Closer-Look

Explore the cosmos and have a blast with our Virtual Reality (VR) experience that leverages core VR principles such as occlusion, teleportation, and stick movement. This project showcases the fusion of these principles with the power of C# coding to create an immersive and educational VR game.

Key Features
VR Principles: Immerse yourself in the world of VR as we employ advanced techniques like occlusion, teleportation, and stick movement to deliver an engaging and authentic experience.

Interactive Learning: Our VR game isn't just about fun; it's an educational journey through the cosmos. Interact with planets, dive into their unique characteristics, and expand your knowledge of the universe.

Asteroid Mini-Game: For added excitement, we've included an entertaining asteroid mini-game. Dodge, shoot, and survive in space as you navigate a thrilling asteroid field.

While I made the astroird mini game and added a couple affordances, Nick Luckangelo did the world building as well as the educational side of game.

Here is our project pitch. Enjoy!
